## How to Use Search

- Use the search bar at the top of any page to quickly find terms, models, or processes.
- Enclose codes in quotes (e.g., `"M.SM1.001"`) to find specific table rows.
- Search is typo-tolerant and will suggest corrections for common misspellings.
- Results show a preview/snippet for context.
- Search terms are highlighted in the results.

## Abbreviations and Synonyms

- Common abbreviations (e.g., DCE, MRI, ROI) are recognized. Hover over underlined abbreviations for definitions.
- Synonyms and alternative names are indexed—try searching for any common term.

## Fuzzy Search and "Did You Mean"

- If you make a typo, the search will suggest the closest matching term.
- Try partial words or common misspellings—relevant results will still appear.

## Search Result Previews

- Each result includes a snippet of the surrounding text for context.
- Click a result to jump directly to the relevant section.

## Highlighting

- Your search terms are highlighted in the results for easy scanning.

## More Tips

- For best results, use specific terms or codes.
- If you can't find what you're looking for, try a synonym or abbreviation.
