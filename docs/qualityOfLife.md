## Quality of life additions

This section will introduce you to some tools available on this website to make your experience better.

## Copying reference to table data for publications

Inside the data tables you can find a button that says `COPY LINK`. Click on it and the reference to the data cell will be copied into your clipboard. You can use this reference in your publications.

## Copying reference DOI

You can right-click on any [link](#copying-reference-doi), such as a reference to a paper and one of the options is `Copy link address`. All references should be linked either via their DOI or PubMed repository of the paper. If this is not the case, please [report it](https://github.com/OSIPI/OSIPI_CAPLEX/issues){target="_blank"}.

## Search bar

<b><font color=#FF0000>This feature is currently worked on. Your [feedback](https://forms.gle/dsfUEZx6P91rBwJe6){target="_blank"} would be greatly appreciated.</font></b>

At the top of the webpage, you may find the `Search` bar allowing you to find resources within the website quickly. If you wish to find a table row by code, enclose the code using `""`, for example to find Gradient echo model you could search for `"M.SM1.001"`.

!!! warning
    
    The greek letters rendered using MathJax cannot be searched for at the moment.

## Zooming into equations

<b><font color=#FF0000>Please [let us know](https://forms.gle/dsfUEZx6P91rBwJe6){target="_blank"} if the zoom needs to be increased for any particular equation.</font></b>

You can zoom into equations by double-clicking on them. $\text{Try me!}$

!!! warning
    
    Zooming into the page using `CTRL + +` may cause tables to be partially obstructed by the Table of Contents.

## Copying equation's TeX code.

If you wish to copy any equation to use elsewhere, right-click on the equation. A dropbox should appear where the first option is `Show Math As`. Hover over this option to open another dropbox. Click on `TeX Commands`. The code creating the equation opens in a new window. Select it with your mouse or press `CTRL + A` followed by `CTRL + C` to copy.
